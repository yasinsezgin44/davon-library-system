# Implementation Plan - Davon Library System

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for the Davon Library System based on the UML models located in `/docs/diagrams/`.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

### Tasks:

1. Set up project architecture and environment

   - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Configure routing, state management, and authentication libraries
   - Establish coding standards and Git workflow

2. Implement User Entity & Authentication (based on User-Member-ClassDiag.png)

   - Create base User entity with core attributes
   - Implement User service layer for CRUD operations
   - Develop AuthContext and AuthService for state management
   - Build Login, Registration and ResetPassword components

3. Create Admin/Member specialized entities
   - Implement inheritance structure for User types
   - Develop role-based access control system
   - Create user profile management functionality

### Deliverables:

- Working authentication system with login/registration flows
- User profile management with role-based permissions
- Basic administrative user management interface

## Phase 2: Book and Inventory Management

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

### Tasks:

1. Implement Book and Inventory entities (based on Book-LibraryInventory-ClassDiag.png)

   - Create Book entity with full metadata support
   - Develop BookCopy entity to represent physical copies
   - Implement Category, Author, and Publisher related entities
   - Build Inventory service for managing book collections

2. Create Book Management interfaces (based on BookManagement-UseCase.png)

   - Develop interfaces for adding, editing, and removing books
   - Implement search and filtering capabilities
   - Create book detail views with metadata display
   - Build category and author management tools

3. Create Admin Book Management tools
   - Develop dashboard for inventory overview
   - Implement batch operations for books
   - Create reporting tools for collection insights

### Deliverables:

- Complete book inventory system
- Admin tools for catalog management
- Book search and browsing functionality
- Category and metadata management

## Phase 3: Borrowing and Reservation System

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

### Tasks:

1. Implement Loan and Reservation entities (based on Borrowing-Transaction-ClassDiag.png)

   - Create Loan entity with status tracking
   - Develop Reservation system with timeouts
   - Implement status enumerations and state transitions
   - Build validation rules for borrowing limits

2. Develop borrowing workflows (based on Borrowing-Returning-UseCase.png)

   - Create checkout process for members
   - Implement return processing with fine calculation
   - Develop reservation management
   - Build notification system for due dates and holds

3. Create Librarian tools (based on Librarian-UseCase.png)
   - Develop circulation desk interface
   - Implement member account management
   - Create fine processing and payment tracking
   - Build reporting tools for circulation metrics

### Deliverables:

- End-to-end book borrowing and return system
- Reservation management with waitlists
- Fine calculation and tracking
- Circulation reporting dashboard

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Integration

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

### Tasks:

1. Implement advanced member features

   - Develop borrowing history and recommendations
   - Create personalized dashboards
   - Implement notification preferences
   - Build reading lists and favorites

2. Enhance administrative capabilities

## Phase 5: Testing, Documentation & Deployment

**Duration: 2 weeks**

### Tasks:

1. Comprehensive testing

   - Implement unit tests for all core functionality
   - Conduct integration testing across modules
   - Perform user acceptance testing
   - Run security and performance audits

2. Documentation finalization

   - Complete user guides
   - Finalize system documentation
   - Create maintenance procedures
   - Develop training materials

3. Deployment preparation
   - Configure production environments
   - Establish deployment pipelines
   - Create backup and recovery procedures
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

### Deliverables:

- Fully tested system
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production deployment
- Maintenance and support plan

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical implementation path follows this sequence:

1. User Authentication → Book Management → Borrowing System

Core dependencies:

- Borrowing system depends on both User and Book entities
- Admin tools depend on their respective entity implementations
- Advanced features depend on core functionality completion

Parallel development opportunities:

- UI components can be developed concurrently with backend services
- Book entity implementation can begin while User authentication is being completed
- Documentation can progress throughout all phases
